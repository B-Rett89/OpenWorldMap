OpenWorldMap

OpenWorldMap is a 1009x1009 open-world terrain designed in Unreal Engine 5.4.2.This is my first publicly shared map, uploaded to GitHub for version control and future development.

✨ Features

1009 x 1009 world size

🌲 Forested areas (planned)

🌾 Open plains (planned)

⛰️ Mountain terrain (bare shape in place)

🌊 Coastal and sea regions (planned)

This project currently includes the bare landscape shape only — no textures, water, foliage, or other content has been added yet. It serves as a base for future open-world map development and iteration.
